##Motivation

 Almost all mobile app is iApp that will call backend web APIs pull or submit data, we want a grace solution suport the RESTfull APIs layer in our app, slipt the network API logic layer and  View layer, in other words, we want coder should change the tranditional thinking that coding the web call in View or Controller layer but should in SDK layer indeed. 

 All RESTfull APIs will be map to a static method, that will be easy maintenance, easy extendable also simply to apply in App development.
